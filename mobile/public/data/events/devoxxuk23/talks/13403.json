  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">For so many years, developers have been taught by the \"craftsmen\" of the world that quick-and-dirty is a sin, an evil that must be rooted out and destroyed wherever it is found. What if I told you that not only is quick-and-dirty not the outright abomination that \"thought leaders\" make it out to be, but a necessary tool to have... and should be a critical component of every project you build from here on out?</span></p>",
