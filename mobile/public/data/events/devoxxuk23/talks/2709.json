  "description": "<p>Software development has become more complex over the years: Building and running a distributed architecture in the cloud, ensuring observability, and keeping a healthy balance between dev speed and code quality isn’t easy. They say' Just be agile, practice DevOps, and increase developer productivity' but does that really solve the problem?</p><p>Join Sven and learn how great software teams measure and improve their developer experience, coordinate work across teams, reduce wait times, and create a healthy and joyful engineering culture. Instead of focusing just on developer productivity we shouldn’t lose sight of what makes this craft fun for engineers.</p>"
