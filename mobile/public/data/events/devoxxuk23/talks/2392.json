  "description": "<p>Join us to learn the challenges we faced and the solutions we implemented moving Adobe Experience Manager, an existing product built mostly in Java, to Kubernetes.</p><p><br></p><p>Moving to a Cloud Native architecture took changes in culture, processes and technologies. Teams collaborate with a DevOps philosophy and a \"you build it, you run it\" approach, providing teams with freedom. Most services are now written in Java, Javascript or Go, depending on each service.</p><p>The need to scale triggered a micro-service architecture to support the existing app, and to scale the development organization. This drove the creation of API first services and operators with independent SLOs that work together to provide the full product. Running in multiple Kubernetes clusters across regions forced high levels of automation and Continuous Delivery pipelines, tied with monitoring and alerting across the globe.</p><p><br></p><p>We will dig into specific details of Java that require more attention when migrating to Kubernetes, like resource management, decomposition of services or availability amongst others.</p><p><br></p>",
