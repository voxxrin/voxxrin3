  "description": "<p>The Met Office is the UK's national meteorological service. In the area of \"Public Hazards and Resilience\" we run some \"life-and-limb\" services which are particularly well fitted to going serverless -- things that don't run at high volume but demand very high reliability and supportability, like National Weather Warnings dissemination, or benefit from easy processing concurrency, like the Surface Water Flooding Hazard Impacts tool.  We have been running these in Java on AWS, with Lambdas and Step Functions, some for over five years now.&nbsp;In this presentation I will talk about how we've set the services up, with practical decisions about domain objects and dependency injection; the testing strategy that works for us; what we've learnt from supporting them over the years; and how this architecture has helped in implementing the changes that all services inevitably face over time.&nbsp;I'll talk about&nbsp;the benefits and trade-offs, and touch on possible future developments in the area of serverless Java</p>",
