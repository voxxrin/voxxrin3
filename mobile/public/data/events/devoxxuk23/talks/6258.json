  "description": "<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs, but what are the advantages and how would one implement such in their microservices/APIs. In this session, I will go through the basics of GraphQL, different aspects of GraphQL, and the architecture of such APIs. Most importantly, how 4 different ways we can implement GraphQL for a Springboot microservice/API. Lots of examples, live coding, and helpful comparison on structure, usage, and implementations of GraphQL in Springboot &amp; Java world.</p>",
