  "description": "<p>When working on complex systems, inefficiencies can creep in – generally caused by an evolution of a component beyond the scope of its original purpose. This can make</p><p>engineering new features difficult and introduce risk.</p><p>If you’ve ever worked on systems like this, you will know how hard it is to address Tech Debt while developing new features: the equivalent of changing the wheels on a moving car.</p><p><br></p><p>In this session, I will describe how we improved developer efficiency on a complex service running in AWS covering:</p><p>- How to start, setting principals and goals</p><p>- Which tech we used and how we used it</p><p>- What changed/got better as a result</p>",
