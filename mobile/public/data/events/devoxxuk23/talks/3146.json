  "description": "<p>Itâ€™s time to get on board with reading and understanding reactive code because:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>The latest releases of our favorite frameworks are embracing reactive programming</li><li>Asynchronous APIs are gaining in popularity, and not just on the front-end side</li><li>A cohesive stack is reactive all the way from the database to the UI</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, it may be a challenge to adapt your mindset to asynchronous database access after years of writing synchronous, blocking code. This talk discusses the reasons reactive programming is a great fit for database access and presents a list of common access patterns to read or write data, and to succeed, fail, or retry requests to the database.</p>",
