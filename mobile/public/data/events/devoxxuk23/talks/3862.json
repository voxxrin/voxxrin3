  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 43, 77);\">Full Stack Developer usually means you know how to build a web app with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Angular, React, TypeScript, Java, SQL, NoSQL and many cloud services. That's great, but also a lot of stuff to know and keep up with.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 43, 77);\">I propose a different solution: Why don't we work just with Java?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 43, 77);\">Focusing on one part of that stack should allow us to master that part and be more productive. Also, maintenance and onboarding new team members to such a project should be easier.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 43, 77);\">Join me and learn how to build enterprise-ready web apps with supported open-source frameworks like MicroStream and Vaadin with just basic Java knowledge. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 43, 77);\">This is the right talk for you if you liked how things were done in Java Swing.</span></p>",
