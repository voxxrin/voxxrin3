  "description": "<p>In this session, I will do a live demo of an automated earth observation pipeline. We start with a live data downlink from JPSS-1, a last-gen NASA weather satellite, with AWS GroundStation. I will then show how to configure AWS GroundStation to communicate with a satellite and how to process the raw satellite data on AWS. Lastly, I show how ML can be used to gain immediate insights into satellite imagery</p>"
