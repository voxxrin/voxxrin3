  "title": "Atomic Decomposition in AI systems using Knative Eventing and Quarkus",
  "description": "<p>A dive into the cool new technology of Knative Eventing using Quarkus to build complex applications using simple to write and agile components. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In this presentation and demo Ian will talk in depth about why atomic decomposition&nbsp;of applications combined with 'on-demand application capabilities' via Knative is so important for writing complex applications that take a much smaller resource footprint than microservices/monoliths. Also, using Quarkus, how easy it is to get started on this form of Event Driven Architecture approach to application design. In particular&nbsp;the&nbsp;use of these techniques in an AI perspective, building dynamic and fluid Neural Net simulations&nbsp;that allow complex applications to be easily&nbsp;realised quickly and resource efficiently.</span></p><p><br></p><p>This talk will include a demo assuming the demo Gods allow.</p><p><br></p>",
