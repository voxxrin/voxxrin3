  "description": "<p>You've figured out how to split up your backend services into microservices and scale your teams to the moon, right?</p><p><br></p><p>But what about the frontend? Are you still building monoliths for your UI?</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you might want to check out micro frontendsâ€”basically extensions to the microservices pattern, where the concept is extended to the frontend.</p><p><br></p><p>Find out how to package and deploy your microservices and their UIs in the same artifact, as well as make it possible to test and develop them independently.</p><p><br></p><p>In this live session, Matt will show you how to build a microservices and micro frontends architecture using React, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud.</p>",
