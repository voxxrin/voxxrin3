  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Over the last couple of years, our industry faced many naysayers doubting that Java is ready for today's, let alone tomorrow's application development requirements. Too rigid, too fat, too slow, and too resource hungry were the usual suspects to question Java's \"fitness\" for developing cloud-native applications targeting Kubernetes. One day, Quarkus came along to demonstrate the exact opposite. Join this fast-paced session to learn about Quarkus, which is a new breed of Java application development framework. It builds upon well-established standards and technologies as well as battle-tested libraries, many of which you might already master or at least be familiar with. If you want to experience some of the goodness and love that Quarkus offers around its dev services and native image building capabilities on top of GraalVM this talk is for you. After this session, you'll have a first impression about what it means and how it feels to develop supersonic subatomic Java applications for the cloud era.</span></p>",
