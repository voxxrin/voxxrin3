  "description": "<p>The infrared (IR) piano is an IoT maker project. <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Weâ€™ll go behind the scenes of the its development to see its design iterations, hear stories of sensor troubleshooting, examine the code, and learn how you can create similar projects. </span>The IR Piano is built from K'Nex, a linear potentiometer, piezo speaker, LCD screen, and two IR distance sensors.<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span>The IR sensors detect where you place your hand over two sets of keys. The speaker beeps at a frequency matching the note for that key. The LCD prints the distance detected by each IR sensor. And the linear potentiometer controls volume. The sensors and devices are from TinkerForge. They provide API bindings for a variety of languages including C/C++, Java, Python, Go, and Rust. In the case of C/C++, the bindings are easily obtained with the open-source package manager Conan.</p>",
