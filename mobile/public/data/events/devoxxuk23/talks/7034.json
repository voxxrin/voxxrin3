  "description": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Many organisations are migrating their existing Java applications or developing new ones with Kubernetes as the target platform. However, sooner or later they find out there is a lot of fine tuning on production.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Many teams are confronted with some issues that keep their Java applications from running smoothly on Kubernetes like high memory consumption, high latency and slow startup times. Most of these issues are caused due to lack of knowledge about JVM ergonomics. In this session I would like to talk about some of these issues and how to tackle them based on real project experience.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Furthermore I would like to talk about the advantages of choosing Java Frameworks that are better suited for the cloud. I will show you a small demo to highlight the difference among some of the very popular Java frameworks such as Spring Boot, Quarkus, Micronaut, among others.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">After this session, you will have a better understanding on how to fine-tune your Java applications for Kubernetes as well as a better overview of the great framework options out there for running Java cloud native applications based on real production projects.</p><p><br></p>",
