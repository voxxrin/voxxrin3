  "description": "<p>You've probably been hearing quite a bit about AI tooling such as ChatGPT, CoPilot and Stable Diffusion the past months and are wondering how to use them in your work as a Java engineer. You don't have to worry about building the next SkyNet or other disasters, but you will have to be aware of pitfalls such as bias and other unwanted side-effects to create value with AI in a responsible manner.</p><p><br></p><p>In this talk we'll walk through a number of recent AI tools, elaborate how they work, which value they add and how to apply them responsibly while creating value for your customers, your organisation and yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The talk is aimed at Java engineers new to AI and those already experienced looking for responsible implementations or new possibilities.</p>",
