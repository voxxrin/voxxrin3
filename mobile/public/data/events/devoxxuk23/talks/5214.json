  "description": "<p>What would happen if we would bring design, front end, back end etc. all together? How could we improve the user-flows by thinking of alternative, non-happy flows? What would happen to the performance and therefore the user-experience when back end is already involved before the finalised wireframes are handed over?!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>That's all nice and dandy. But we do need to deal with some concerns like:</p><p>-\tKnowledge gap: How can the different disciplines with their specialty understand each other and come to conclusions?</p><p>-\tShared responsibilities: Where do start and where do they end?</p><p>-\tEfficiency: What would it do to the efficiency of the team when they get different tasks?</p><p><br></p><p>In this talk weâ€™ll try to address and hopefully take away those concerns and focus on the benefits it will bring, working in a hybride team.</p>",
