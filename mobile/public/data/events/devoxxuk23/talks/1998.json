You’ll learn about growing your personal brand (what is it good for?), the trials and tribulations of different roles (so many choices), becoming a manager (or not), mentoring and sponsoring (they are not the same thing), how to care for yourself (prevent burnout), and lots more career advice.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">You‘ll hear about their inevitable bumps in the road (or downright failures), as well as their successes. As it turns out, having a great developer career is not all about the technology and the code; it's also about you and the people around you!</span></p>",
