  "description": "<h4>Included in the JDK installation are a lot of handy tools for Java developers, from java itself to jshell, jcmd, jfr, jlink and jdeprscan. These allow you to analyse a running JVM, generate JRE's, run Java source code and much more. In this talk I would like to present a number of these tools with practical examples and thus expand the toolbox of the participants.</h4><h4>Async profiler, jbang and sdkman are not part of the JDK but too useful to ignore.</h4><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>With the command line tools, many tasks can be automated and executed more efficiently, leaving more time for the exciting things in developer life.</h4>",
