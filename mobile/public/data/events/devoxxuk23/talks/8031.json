  "description": "<p>Java 17 announced the depreciation of the Security Manager (which is ok since hardly anyone used it) but that doesn’t mean the JVM leaves you vulnerable.&nbsp;There are many design features in the JVM and the JDK that are there to help keep your application safe from harm. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In this session, we’ll walk through these points - from compiler, to bytecode to runtime and give you a refresher on how to get the best from these features.&nbsp;We’ll also look at new things in the works, compile-to-native consequences and even some off-the-wall “it’s just an idea”&nbsp;thoughts about how to make the JVM an even more secure environment. &nbsp;</p>",
