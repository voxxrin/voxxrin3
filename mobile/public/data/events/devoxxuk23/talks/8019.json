  "description": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A Connected Autonomous Vehicle and some IoT enabled traffic lights have an interaction in the real world but also in the virtual realm of a cyber-physical infrastructure. How can these two autonomous agents cooperate across secured boundaries of domain, ownership and objectives in a decentralised “fediverse”? Particularly if the car and the traffic lights are implemented using differing platforms, APIs, stacks, and languages.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Using&nbsp;a toy car and some model traffic lights controlled by a Raspberry Pi, we'll demonstrate code to achieve autonomous interoperability between using semantic-web enabled APIs in a polyglot environment (Java, Python, gRPC, REST).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Then we will show how this particular interaction can be generalised to enable disparate real-world objects with diverse ownership, heterogeneous data, and competing selfish interests but a general need to cooperate to achieve a common objective.</span></p>",
