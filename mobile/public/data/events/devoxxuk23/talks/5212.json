  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(103, 106, 108);\">Even the smallest design flaws can have a seismic effect on business. Yet dev teams continually miss the little things. Why? Join me on a tour of seemingly insignificant interface design quirks (and the larger flaws behind them) that have changed history, caused mass panic, otherwise upended society, and completely ruined my sandwich.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(103, 106, 108);\">Because digital products are central to modern life, our day-to-day work has monumental purpose and value. We banish interface rage, help businesses save and make serious money. We keep people safe from disaster and yes, pickles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(103, 106, 108);\">We'll explore why small interface problems are never the whole story behind historic (or mundane) UI failures. You'll come away with a stronger sense of purpose in the smallest details and broader context of your important dev work.</span></p>",
