  "description": "<p>It's a leap of faith, right? Thinking that you like building applications to doing it as a career. However, thinking does not always need to be a precursor to doing, they can exist side by side. That passion that drove you to build a task manager app can still be the passion to help you understand when to push for a different architecture. You just need to be smart about it. In this talk I will discuss various pet projects, and more importantly, the skills I learnt that helped me advocate for different approaches in a production environments. This includes:</p><ul><li>tests</li><li>design patterns</li><li>ethics</li></ul><p>p.s. tests always lead to some sort of controversy. Whatever you decide, I hope this helps you hold your ground. </p>",
