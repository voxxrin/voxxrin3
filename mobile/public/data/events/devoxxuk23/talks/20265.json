  "description": "<p>In recent years, Java and Java frameworks have evolved significantly, especially due to changing environments in which they must be deployed. Developers have had the most impact on Java in recent years as they have adopted Cloud and specifically Kubernetes.&nbsp; A number of significant changes are coming for developers, such as the push for Secure Software Supply Chain, AI/ML, and Edge Computing. Keeping Java relevant to these growing developer communities will require continued evolution. In this session, we will examine these influences and others and suggest how Java should adapt to these changes.</p><p><br></p>",
