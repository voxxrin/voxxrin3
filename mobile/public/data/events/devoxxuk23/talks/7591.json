  "description": "<p>Having applications exposed to the Internet means you must question the right and permissions of the entities accessing them. Securing a piece of software is not just enabling HTTPS or using the right tools; it is an entire setup of tools, application code, and infrastructure configurations that interface with the world.</p><p><br></p><p>This session will guide you on how to use Cert Manager to generate and maintain TLS/SSL certificates, integrate them in a Java-friendly way at the application level, create secure HTTPS gateways using Istio and expose those outside a Kubernetes cluster.</p><p><br></p><p>During this talk you'll find out how to:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Generate TLS/SSL certificates using Cert Manager.</li><li>Use Cert Manager resources within 2 Java apps (one built on top of Helidon, the other one on top of Quarkus) </li><li>Enable mutual authentication at the Java application level, explore recent Java language security improvements and use Istio destination rules and gateways with mutual TLS</li></ul><p>After this talk, you'll know your options for making secure HTTPS Istio gateways for Java applications running on Kubernetes.</p>"
