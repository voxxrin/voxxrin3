  "description": "<p><span class=\"ql-cursor\">ï»¿</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In this talk, I will share my journey of using machine learning in Java to build a visual recognition system that can identify Lego blocks. As a Java developer, I wanted to use Java for this project rather than Python, which is more commonly used for machine learning projects. I will explain the basics of machine learning and give an overview of the current Java libraries for machine learning and transferring pre-trained models. I will demonstrate how to train and modify existing models using transfer learning. The goal of the project is to create a Java solution that can identify the top 1000 most popular Lego bricks. I will explain all of this without using any complex mathematical formulas, making it accessible to those with no prior knowledge of machine learning.</span></p>"
