  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 17, 17);\">In this session we'll look at 8 Java quirks that might be surprising at a first glance. First we'll look at a code snippet with apparently \"wrong\" behaviour and then look at why things are as they are. </span><span style=\"color: rgb(36, 41, 47);\">The idea of the talk is to present unexpected and lesser know features of the Java programming language. All examples have an educative purpose and are not meant to be best practises or to be used in production code. The talk will be given with live coding in TDD style.</span></p>",
