  "title": "Building a Secure CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and Snyk for Java Applications",
  "description": "<p>GitHub Actions has revolutionized the way developers build and deploy software. With its seamless integration into GitHub repositories, you can automate your entire CI/CD pipeline, from build and test to deployment. However, securing your pipeline is equally important as automating it.</p><p><br></p><p>Join us for an action-packed workshop where we will show you how to create a secure CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions using Snyk. We will walk you through the process of integrating security scanning and monitoring as part of your pipeline. By the end of this workshop, you will have a thorough understanding of how to automate security scanning and monitoring in your build cycle before production, ensuring that your software is always secure.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
