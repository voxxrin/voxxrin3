  "description": "<p>Our cloud-native environments are more complex than ever before! So, how can we ensure that the applications we’re deploying to them are behaving as we intended them to? This is where effective observability is crucial. It enables us to monitor our applications in real-time and analyse and diagnose their behaviour in the cloud. However, until recently, we were lacking the standardisation to ensure our observability solutions were applicable across different platforms and technologies. In this session, we’ll delve into what effective observability really means, exploring open source technologies and specifications, like OpenTelemetry, that can help us to achieve this while ensuring our applications remain flexible and portable.</p>",
