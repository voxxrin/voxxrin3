  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 17, 17);\">While busy constantly improving the way we work we can sometimes forget that software developers are not the only ones looking to improve.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 17, 17);\">With competition around the corner, there is a continuous drive to improve in sports. Coaches, trainers, teachers and athletes are focused every day on improving. In traditional martial arts, the practitioners are working hard to improve a single technique. What can we learn from the way the pros work? How is hierarchy affecting performance? And what techniques are they using to get to a higher level? How can the ancient way of improving Martial Arts be translated into Software Development? After this talk, I hope you are inspired to approach improving in a different way.</span></p><p><br></p>",
