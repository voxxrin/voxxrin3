  "description": "<p>Are you familiar with Spring and like learning new things?</p><p><br></p><p>In this session, I will show concepts and conventions familiar to Spring developers and how those same concepts and conventions can be implemented in Quarkus, all while highlighting similarities and differences between them. Additionally, I will show similarities and differences in how testing is done, highlighting Quarkus Dev Services and continuous testing.</p><p><br></p><p>This session will be mostly live coding while minimizing the amount of slides. I will introduce an existing Spring application with a full test suite and build a Quarkus equivalent version of it, live. Content will come from my book, \"<a href=\"https://red.ht/quarkus-spring-devs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\"><em>Quarkus for Spring Developers</em></a>.\"</p>",
