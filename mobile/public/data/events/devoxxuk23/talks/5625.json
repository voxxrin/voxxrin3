  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Montessori approach has revolutionised the education system by putting the child at the centre of the class and by treating children like adults. We will look at what it means to \"treat adults like children\" and why, even if it's still common, it's such a bad idea. During the past 3 years, I have been using a subset of the Montessori Principles that are relevant to our work environment, and I'll show you how they will help you promote autonomy while being supportive.  </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><span class=\"ql-cursor\">ï»¿</span>It will be fascinating and fun to see how much children's motivation is similar to adults' and how this parallel can help us make better decisions daily. You will learn, for example, how to balance coaching and delivery and simple strategies to enhance the effectiveness of your teams.</span></p>",
