  "description": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">We all know that observability is a must-have for operating systems in production. But we often neglect our own backyard - our software release process. That was our mistake, which led us to wasting time and energy in handling failures in the CI/CD pipeline, and made our Developer-on-Duty (DoD) shifts tedious.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">On this talk I’d like to share how we built effective observability into our CI/CD pipeline using intelligent data collection, dashboarding and alerting, to boost our response to failures and improve our quality of life on the way.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This talk will give practical guidance on how to improve observability into your CI/CD pipeline. Whether you use Jenkins like we do, or other CI/CD tools, you’ll learn how to augment them and reach higher productivity.</span></p>",
