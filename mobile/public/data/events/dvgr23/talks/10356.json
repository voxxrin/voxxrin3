  "description": "<p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has transformed the way we manage infrastructure, allowing DevOps and engineers to take ownership of their infrastructure. Terraform is one of the most widely used tools for IaC, enabling teams to create, manage, and provision infrastructure with ease.</p><p>However, as teams grow, the flexibility and speed of development can have negative consequences for security and granular access practices. In this presentation, we will explore best practices for writing Terraform-specific policies using Open Policy Agent (OPA) to ensure secure and efficient infrastructure.</p><p>We will discuss how to decouple decision-making from policy enforcement and enforce security sanity checks to our Terraform pipelines. Additionally, we will examine how key services of the Terraform ecosystem, Atlantis and Infratest can be used to combine policy decisions, enhancing engineering ownership and creating a more efficient development process.</p><p>Join us to learn how to unlock the full potential of your team with Terraform and OPA, and implement best practices for secure and efficient Infrastructure as Code.</p>",
