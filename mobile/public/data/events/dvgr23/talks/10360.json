  "title": "Low-code and Pro coders: Friends or Foes?",
  "description": "<p>Low code platforms usage and deployments are on the rise mainly due to the lack of pro coders and partly because it allows for business users to become part of the coding pool. However, pro coders usually snub the tools and the people using them as they take away from the brainy creativity of writing code the “proper” way. Is there a way these two can be friends? Can these platforms be of service to pro coders the way they were intended to work i.e. perform the mundane tasks so that they can do the “heavy thinking”?</p>",
