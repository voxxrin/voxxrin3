  "description": "<p>For years, when we needed to expose Web API for our web app, we went for REST API. In fact, most of us do that also today.</p><p>However - the landscape has changed, and today we have additional alternatives for our Web API implementation, namely:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>REST API</li><li>GraphQL</li><li>gRPC</li></ul><p>But how can we choose between them?</p><p><br></p><p>In this session, we'll discuss just that. We'll:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Have a quick overview of each of these APIs</li><li>Discuss the pros and cons of each API</li><li>Learn about the API Flowchart, guiding us for the right API to use</li></ul><p><br></p><p>At the end of this session, you'll be well equipped to choose the best API for your needs.</p>",
