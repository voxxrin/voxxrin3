  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In this talk, I will show you a step-by-step process of building two simple Spring Boot 3 Services and working with the Resilience4j library to ensure we can handle any transient faults that may occur when one service calls the other. I will discuss the different ways to expose your microservices. What is Retry Policy? What is Circuit Breaker Policy? What is Infrastructure-based resiliency? And how to implement them in Spring Boot 3 apps.</span></p>",
