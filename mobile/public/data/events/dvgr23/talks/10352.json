  "description": "<p>Is it possible to have a platform that analyzes data for more than 500 million people, makes 40 million credit decisions and 25 million micro-loans per day, and does all that by using only open-source technologies? The answer is yes, and the platform is OPTASIA!</p><p><br></p><p>OPTASIA is the AI technology platform for financial inclusion. The platform is deployed in 35 countries and issues micro-loans to more than 250 million users per year. Within the OPTASIA platform lies a Data &amp; AI factory that supports efficient and optimal credit decision-making. The Data &amp; AI factory handles large-scale data, empowers the development of ML models for credit decisioning and facilitates their operationalization. At the core of the factory are advanced data and analytical pipelines, and state-of-the-art Machine Learning flows, all built on open-source technologies. In this talk we present the architecture of the Data &amp; AI factory within the OPTASIA platform and our experience of building it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
