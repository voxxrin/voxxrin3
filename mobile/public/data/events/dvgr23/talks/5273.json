  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Quarkus mission is to transform your entire application, including its libraries, into an artifact that uses significantly fewer resources than traditional approaches. These can then be used to build native applications using GraalVM. To do this, you need to analyze and understand the whole \"closed world\" of the application. The best that can be achieved without the full context is partial and limited generic support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In this session, we will unleash the power of Quarkus Extensions, and show you how to achieve all the Quarkus cool features, like hot reloading, Dev Services, or native compilation to any Java library.</span></p>",
