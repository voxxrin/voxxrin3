  "description": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Blue-green deployment is an approach to managing software releases that aim to mitigate risks and decrease system downtime. This technique employs two separate production environments, referred to as Blue and Green, to facilitate dependable testing, seamless upgrade procedures without service interruption, and the immediate undoing of changes. We will talk about the challenges we faced applying this approach to an event-based architecture and how we can create CI/CD pipeline that deploys a Kubernetes application using this methodology. </span><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>",
