  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 46, 74);\">Who said games arenâ€™t educational? Learning a new programming language on your own is never easy, and you often find yourself stuck and frustrated. In this session I will talk about how through developing a simple 2D game I was able to wrap my imperative mind around a functional programming language and learn Clojure. We will also go through the core concepts of functional programming and I will show you code examples that will prove you that your favorite arcade game can be an excellent tool to master Clojure or any other functional programming language.</span></p>",
