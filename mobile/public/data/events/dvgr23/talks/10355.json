Just about any valid HTML is valid Marko, but Marko extends the HTML language to allow building modern applications in a declarative way: it's like HTML and JavaScript had a perfect baby that grew up to be awesome. I would like to introduce you in practice to this&nbsp;fascinating&nbsp;framework and share some best practices; I will also present my pet project based on Marko.</span></p>",
