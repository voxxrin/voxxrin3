Right?!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Since its genesis in the 1980s to the 433 qubit IBM Osprey arriving in November 2022, a long road has been travelled. Science fiction is becoming science fact. A new branch of computing with its own complexity classes, and computational quirks (but no quarks) means a whole new world for developers to explore. However, new complexities present new challenges and interesting claims which are difficult to verify and unlikely.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Have we established quantum primacy? Are we in a world of quantum advantage? Why is it unlikely researchers have shown they can break RSA-2048 with only 372 qubits? Why does this mean we really need to get a handle on implementing NIST Post Quantum Algorithms right now?! This is what this talk aims to explain.</span></p><p><br></p>",
