  "description": "<p>Apache Kafka is the de-facto standard for high-performance data streaming applications. Such applications are infrequently about pure message processing. They often need to integrate Kafka messages with a remote endpoint, persist messages to a data store, or relay them to a third-party service.</p><p><br></p><p>This talk presents how Quarkus, in combination with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, lets you build Kafka-based event-driven architectures. We will illustrate the concepts and common patterns using a sample application and show how Quarkus makes the development of event-driven microservices smooth and straightforward while integrating naturally with Quarkus' reactive core. Expect lots of live coding, showcasing live reload, Dev UI, continuous testing, etc.</p>",
