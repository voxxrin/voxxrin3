  "description": "<p>Qwik is a JavaScript framework that uses a new rendering paradigm called resumability. It can serialize a JavaScript app into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique used in meta-frameworks like Next.js. Is Qwik the world's first O(1) JavaScript framework? Let's find out.</p><p><br></p><p>Qwik lets us build \"resumable apps\" by requiring nearly zero JavaScript for pages to become interactive + fine-grained lazy loading to only load what's used. I will teach you how to start with Qwik on this topic.</p><p><br></p><p>We will cover the following topics: What is Qwik framework, Qwik vs. React, Qwik vs. Angular, How to make JS bundle smaller, and how to get started building with Qwik.</p>",
