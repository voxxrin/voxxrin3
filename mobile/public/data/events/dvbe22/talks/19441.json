  "description": "<p>When it comes to performance, many developers take for granted statements (myths) that are not always valid, no longer correct, or were never accurate.</p><p>Performance and benchmarking were always tough topics, and in languages such as java and scala, there are so many layers between code and machine that any analysis seems futile.&nbsp;</p><p>We will, however, try to do this and check a few exciting examples of scala code snippets down to the \"bare metal\".</p><p>We will use recent JVM versions, including graal and some valuable tools such as</p><p>jitwatch, javap, gc logs, jmh, performance counters.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time someone claims something about performance, you can measure and check it.</p>",
