  "description": "<p>Hey, there are two major Java versions released every year! We don’t have to wait 3 years or so for new features any more. Isn’t that cool? ;-)</p><p>Java was supposed \"to be slow\". However, Java turns out to evolve so fast, that next releases aren't just version bumps, but might significantly change the rules of the game. That's a good reason to check out what's new in Java.</p><p>To name a few changes:</p><ul><li>Pattern Matching for switch,</li><li>Record Patterns,</li><li>Virtual Threads,</li><li>Calling native stuff,</li><li>Simple Web server,</li><li>what's gone and what will be gone,</li><li>and other stuff.</li></ul><p>If you find them interesting, let’s dive deep together into new interesting stuff.</p>"
