Did you try to check PGP signatures when downloading dependencies, to make sure you are not affected by a Software Supply Chain issue?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Required PGP keys management is usually not the best experience developers have…</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">That’s why the sigstore project was introduced recently, promising easy keyless signatures. It started with Docker images signatures, but a lot of effort is put to extend its usage to every package registry, including Maven Central.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Let’s see how sigstore works and how it is expected to improve not only the signing experience, but also the verification process of artifacts at Maven Central.</span></p>",
