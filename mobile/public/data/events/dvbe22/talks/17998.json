  "description": "<p>The Micronaut framework®&nbsp;is a modern, JVM-based and full-stack for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications. In this session, the co-creator of the framework Graeme Rocher, will demonstrate how the Micronaut framework makes it easy to build cloud-portable Java-based applications.</p><p>Featuring abstractions over common Cloud services such as Email, Object Storage, Database, Tracing and Metrics. Graeme will demonstrate how you can take the same application and successfully re-deploy the application to multiple cloud providers without being concerned that you are introducing coupling to a particular Cloud.</p><p>Graeme will discuss best practises to integrate into your strategies for defining your application build, configuration and code to ensure your application stays Cloud portable in the future, whilst still allowing you to drop down and access Cloud specific APIs and SDKs when necessary.</p><p>The talk will also demonstrate how you can create optimised builds with GraalVM Native Image that ensure maximum efficiently of your application, whichever Cloud you deploy to.</p>"
