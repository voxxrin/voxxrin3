  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(103, 106, 108);\">Colors are an important way to convey information, but there are a lot of people with color blindness and low vision. What if your only way of conveying information is using color? What about an infographic where the color contrast is too low and the information is not reaching the end user, the customer or co-worker? What about missing the deal of your life due to an inaccessible website? In some cases the error: ‘color not found’ will directly lead to: ‘customer or deal not found’. I guess this is not what we want our products to be!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(103, 106, 108);\">In this talk I teach you about color contrast, color blindness and the use of color in UX. I also tell you about tools that you can use to test color accessibility in a lot of use cases.</span></p>",
