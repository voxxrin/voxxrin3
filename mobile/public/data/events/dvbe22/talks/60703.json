  "description": "<p>Development Environments are fragile and hard to set up and maintain. Cloning repositories, installing an editor with the right extensions, and having everything set up to compile, build and debug the application under development is a tedious experience.</p><p>Gitpod is an open-source project that helps teams prepare ready-to-code, containerized development environments specifically for their projects. Such dev environments are described in code that is versioned in Git alongside your source code.</p><p>Integrated with GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket, Gitpod automatically and continuously prebuilds developer environments for all your branches. As a result, team members can instantly start coding with fresh, ephemeral, and fully-initialized dev environments - whether you are building a new feature, fixing a bug, or working on a code review.</p><p>In this session, you will learn why we created Gitpod, how it works and how you can boost your development workflow using it - extensive demos included.</p>"
