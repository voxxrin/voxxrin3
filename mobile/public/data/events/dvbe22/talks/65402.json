  "description": "<p>We will demonstrate how to easily develop, build and deploy modern Spring boot apps on Kubernetes. We'll use convention over configuration for the whole path to production; showing how you can deliver your apps continuously without being a Kubernetes expert. We'll show how to make apps k8s aware with Spring Cloud Kubernetes, how to do CI/CD with a full integration of open source components like Cloud native buildpacks and Flux/Tekton gitops.&nbsp; Knative brings autoscaling ability and advanced deployment patterns like blue-green and canary deployments. Using Backstage as a developer portal enables faster developer onboarding and a one stop shop for all things related to the apps like runtime information, logging and (API) documentation.</p><p><br></p>",
