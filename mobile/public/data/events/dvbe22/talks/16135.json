All actors in the domain are confronted to the same issue : how to ensure a flawless continuity of service whereas systems requests are exponentially increasing ? Climax of the phenomenon, Euro 2020 football excitement.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To prepare that event, at Betclic, we developed a platform to generate some load tests in order to replay past events and associated actions (bet placement, offers reading, etc)&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Based on a datalake which is able to ingest our logs, that solution allows us to simulate a configurable growth (+50 %, + 100%).&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We propose an architecture presentation about tools we set up and used (AWS Glue, Athena), and also our load tests strategies with Gatling tool.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
