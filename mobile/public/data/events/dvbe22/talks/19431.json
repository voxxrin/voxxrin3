  "description": "<p>We all understand development deadlines - though our responses to them vary wildly - plan, grasp, deny, avoid. Love them or hate them development deadlines are a fact of life in software - if we don't deliver then the technical core of growth is not functioning and growth - personal, team, corporate - cannot occur.</p><p>In this talk I explore how working to deadlines can be either a virtuous cycle where everyone takes responsibility and things happen naturally - or a deadly cycle where each step requires maintenance, failure involves finger-pointing and the effort to achieve anything at all astronomical. The difference? Giving staff agency and expecting them to act on it.</p>",
