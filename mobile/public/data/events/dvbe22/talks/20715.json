  "description": "<p>Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection is probably the most underrated specification around. It is the Jakarta EE and MicroProfile corner stone since it provides a standard programming model and a powerful to integrate third party technology in a seamless way.</p><p>Now that major work on CDI 4.0 is nearly over (waiting for Jakarta EE 10 release), it’s interesting to list the evolution of the spec in the last year.</p><p>In this talk we’ll go thru all new and corrected features in the specification and will make a big focus on CDI lite that will enhance CDI spec to better support build time framework like Quarkus.</p><p>We’ll go thru the new portable extension API with a concrete example, and we’ll see how it differs from legacy runtime portable extension.</p><p>You’ll leave the talk being able to develop CDI Lite extension for your favorite framework integrating it to the CDI programming model.</p>",
