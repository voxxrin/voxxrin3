How could we improve the user-flows by thinking of alternative, non-happy flows? What would happen to the performance and therefore the user-experience when back end is already involved before the finalised wireframes are handed over?!&nbsp;</span></p><p>That's all nice and dandy. But we do need to deal with some concerns like:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge gap: How can the different disciplines with their specialty understand each other and come to conclusions?</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared responsibilities: Where do start and where do they end?</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efficiency: What would it do to the efficiency of the team when they get different tasks?</p><p>In this session weâ€™ll dive in together;</p><p>- seeing what the pro's and con's are of a multidisciplinaire way of working,</p><p>- what tips and tricks can be exchanged,</p><p>- and what kind of tools can help in smoothing out the concerns that arise</p>",
