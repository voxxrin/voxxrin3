  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">COVID disinformation, the Capitol riots and the Ukraine invasion stress the critical role of online propagandas on national security and global peace. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Unfortunately, today, the web is ruled by a handful of actors which have been shown to either pay too little attention to the dangerous externalities of their activities, or to actively collaborate with dictators to facilitate their control over their populations. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">In this talk, after stressing the need for alternatives, I will present Tournesol, a proposal for a collaborative governance of information prioritzation on the web. I will also discuss some of numerous technical challenges that must be addressed to make Tournesol secure and trustworthy.</span></p>",
