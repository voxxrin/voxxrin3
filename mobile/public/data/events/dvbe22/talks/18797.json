  "description": "<p>The Montessori approach has revolutionised the education system by putting the child at the centre of the class and by treating children like adults. We will look at the principles of the Montessori approach to see what we can learn to help us promote autonomy while being supportive. It will be fascinating and fun to see how much children's motivation is similar to adults' and how this parallel can help us make better decisions daily. You will learn how to balance coaching and delivery and simple strategies to enhance the effectiveness of your teams.</p>"
