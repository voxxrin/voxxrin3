  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">2022 has brought about an explosion in the world of artificial&nbsp;intelligence. Some have described the current AI trajectory as a shift more profound than the discovery&nbsp;of fire, or the birth of the internet. Google's Transformer architecture—introduced just a few years ago—has permanently changed the landscape, giving rise to hundreds of new AI models around the world, from Abu Dhabi to Switzerland. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">The capabilities of these models are only limited by human imagination, as they generate new code, conceptualize images from scratch,&nbsp;write books,&nbsp;control robots, and much more. Discover the latest models and frameworks beyond GPT-3, from Meta NLLB to Google Pathways. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">See popular AI applications and use cases. And understand what all of this means for the future of artificial general intelligence, and you.</span></p>",
