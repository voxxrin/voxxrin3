In that case, we’re excited to help!!</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As you already know APIs are the building blocks of your application network. They are the medium of communication and involve a lot of data transactions. As per Gartner’s report, API abuse will be the most frequent vector attack, and it’s quite evident. We have heard about the API abuses and attacks quite often.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In order to protect your APIs and provide complete security we will adopt the Zero Trust Security model. We will learn about the Zero trust model and the architecture. We will also understand how to implement the Zero Trust Security in easy steps.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">By the end of the presentation you’ll have a fair idea about API Security and how&nbsp; to protect your API ecosystems using Zero Trust Security. Come along with your queries for us! </span></p><p><br></p>",
