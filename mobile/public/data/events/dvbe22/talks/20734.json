  "description": "<p>OpenTelemetry, or OTel for short, is taking over the observability world to uncover all kinds of performance problems or errors. Let’s look at that hands-on.</p><p>This talk dives into the background of OTel including the technologies its building on (or replacing). It also takes a look at what auto-instrumentation can and cannot achieve. As well as the latest developments beyond tracing with metrics and the first steps towards logging.</p><p>This talk also takes a look at different approaches of integration —&nbsp;the Spring ecosystem is wrapping most of OTel into Micrometer while other frameworks are not. What are the pros and cons of these different integrations for the developers.</p>",
