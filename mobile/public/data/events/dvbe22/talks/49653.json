  "description": "<p>In this session we’ll compare some of the key AI-based coding tools and look at the different ways they could change the way you work.</p><p>AI-augmented coding is here. Products like GitHub Copilot are already making the lives of Java developers easier by streamlining some of the most tedious, repetitive parts of their work. More, like AWS CodeWhisperer, are on the horizon.</p><p>But Java developers won’t be replaced by Skynet just yet. Though they’ve got great potential, GPT (transformer)-based auto-complete tools have clear limitations. What’s more, they’re not the only game in town. Tools like Google’s Alphacode and Diffblue Cover show how AI can be used in different ways to help development teams to work faster, be more productive and spend more time on interesting problems.</p><p>Join this session to learn:</p><ul><li>About different approaches to AI-augmented software development</li><li>Why all approaches aren’t equal, and some pros and cons of each</li><li>How AI can already transform mundane, but vital, tasks like unit testing for Java devs</li></ul>",
