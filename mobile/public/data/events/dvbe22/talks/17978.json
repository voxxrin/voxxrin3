  "description": "<p>I've done my fair share of automating computers and deploying processes. Many things have been said and written and after reading the conference schedule I wasn't sure what to add. Lately, though, I've become intrigued by how computers are automating humans, that is, the creation of photorealistic humans and virtual environments also known as 'synthetic media'.</p><p>I will take you on a tour across lip-synching, face swapping, voice cloning and capturing 3d modelling humans. How close are we at generating humans and what does it mean for our society? From Hollywood VFX over virtual production to AI-generated humans via GAN models and deepfakes, I'd like to explain the topics in a technical engineering way to inspire people in this exciting new field.</p>",
