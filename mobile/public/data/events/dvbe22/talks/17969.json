  "description": "<p>One cluster and one cloud are not enough to guarantee a highly available resilient architecture. For critical systems, it may be crucial to provide triple active resiliency. But how to achieve this?</p><p>This talk shows a triple active architecture based on a cluster mesh between AWS, GCP, and Azure using Kubernetes and Cilium. In addition to a live demo of a working cluster mesh across three clouds, the talk discusses multi-cloud networking and Cilium as a CNI plugin with meshing capabilities. The talk focuses on an honest review of Cilium based on real-life experience. It contains a deep dive into routing and meshing configuration problems, cloud-specific limitations, as well as detailed Cilium performance results in a multi-cloud environment.</p><p>The summary provides guidelines on architectural patterns and functional use cases for cluster meshes with Cilium, highlighting Cilium strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
