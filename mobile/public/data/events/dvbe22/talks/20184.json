  "description": "<p>Being a developer is hard. From knowing the building blocks of programming, through to keeping on top of the latest languages and frameworks. That's before we even think about running systems in production... But at some point, we've all uttered those words 'It works on my machine'. Or, may have looked up code snippets from our favourite search engine...</p><p>What if there was a better way for both? In this demo-led session, Chris will introduce GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, explaining how they can improve your developer experience and make you even more productive!</p><p><br></p>",
