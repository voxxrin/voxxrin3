  "summary": "",
  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 24, 39);\">Residuality theory is a revolutionary new theory of software design that aims to make it easier to design software systems for complex business environments. Residuality theory models software systems as interconnected residues - an alternative to component and process modeling that uses applied complexity science to make managing uncertainty a fundamental part of the design process.</span></p>"
