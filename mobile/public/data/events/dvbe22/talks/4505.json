  "description": "<p>\"<em>You just have deployed your first Kubernetes cluster. You are about to make it accessible to your developers, but your CISO falls on you: he asks you to present all the measures taken to secure the cluster</em>.\" We will start by <strong>auditing the technical configuration </strong>of a Kubernetes cluster in order to <strong>identify vulnerabilities</strong> and <strong>apply patches to technical components</strong>. We will continue with the <strong>exploitation of Kubernetes primitives </strong>to implement security mechanisms (<em>RBAC, AdmissionController, NetworkPolicy, SecurityContext, ...</em>). We will then enrich the cluster with <strong>Open Policy Agent</strong>, a <strong>rules engine</strong> allowing us to apply finer control than Kubernetes primitives. We will also integrate <strong>Falco</strong>, <strong>a behavior analyzer</strong> to detect suspicious actions performed within containers and at the Kubernetes API Server level. We will end with the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline integrating a <strong>vulnerability analysis</strong> carried out with Clair in order to detect compromised images during the build.</p>",
