  "description": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Fleet is the next-generation IDE by JetBrains. It was born lightweight, inherently distributed, and with built-in support for remote development. Let’s see what Fleet is and how one could use it. We’ll go over Fleet’s main features, which include working with many programming languages simultaneously, remote collaboration, and Fleet’s ability to adapt and employ code insight solutions from JetBrains IDEs and LSP (language server protocol) servers available in your favorite ecosystem. Finally, we’ll check out how Fleet helps developers solve everyday problems and run their typical workflows.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
