During this talk, you will discover a method to detect images generated via ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com, with 100% reliability and even a way to know the exact time the photo was produced.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The conference will focus on a technical challenge faced during the implementation of one of the attacks, which involves TensorFlow models leveraging features of a customized ElasticSearch instance, on very limited hardware.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">During this beginner-friendly conference, we'll also cover the basic machine learning concepts needed to make GANs work, and a technique to generate almost undetectable fake faces yourself.</span></p>",
