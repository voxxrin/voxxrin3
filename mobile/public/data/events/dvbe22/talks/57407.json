  "description": "<p>Why are we, developers, very often running behind the schedule?</p><p>Why is the idea of sustainable pace so far from reality?</p><p>There is a clear correlation between these questions and the increasing complexity throughout software development life cycle - SDLC. Development-wise we have the tools to manage and prevent it, such as clean code and architecture. But why does that still happen even though we set these standards?!</p><p>Code is not everything in SDLC (unfortunately). In these session, let's go through some smells, other than code smells. We'll look to the big picture; what makes it unpredictable; what leads to unsustainable pace; and what we've been doing at ARHS to deal with that.</p>",
