  "description": "<p>Last week, you spend the last 2 days writing plenty of tests. Your code coverage was 100% so you thought you could safely leave on a weekend ‚úàÔ∏èüèñÔ∏è</p><p>But on Monday, your inbox is flooded with new bug reports. What happened!? What did you miss?</p><p>In this talk, we present Mutation testing which is a technique to evaluate the quality of tests beyond the number of lines tested. Mutation testing is based on creating a changed copy of the code to ensure a software test suite is able to detect the changes.</p><p>How do we create Mutation tests? How does it work? What are the advantages and drawbacks of Mutation tests? All these questions will be answered with a demo in this talk.</p><p>Come and discover what Mutation testing is and how can we implement it to ensure the quality of our test suites.</p>",
