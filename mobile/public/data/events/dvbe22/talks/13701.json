  "description": "<p>Let’s install YugabyteDB, an open-source PostgreSQL compatible database on Kubernetes. And explain the reasons for it: distribute data to many active nodes, sharded and replicated, in sync, to the region’s data centers for high availability, or geo-distributed to reduce latency for worldwide users. Today, this is possible with distributed SQL databases, bringing powerful SQL and ACID features to the same scalability as the NoSQL datastores.</p>",
