  "description": "<p>Hibernate is the preeminent object/relational mapping solution, and is still immensely popular two decades after it was first introduced to the Java community.</p><p>The Hibernate team recently had an opportunity to ask what Hibernate got wrong, and what could be done about it. Answers to those questions were realized in Hibernate 6, which marks a significant break with the past.</p><p>Simultaneously, the needs of Quarkus pushed the team to create Hibernate Reactive, the first non-blocking ORM.</p><p>In this session, Gavin King will talk about Hibernate 6 and Hibernate Reactive, and of his experience returning to the world of data access after a long absence.</p>",
