  "description": "<p>Over the last 10 years we’ve seen cybercrime accelerate beyond all comprehension, We’ve seen the growing and&nbsp;relentless impact it has on our society and our economies. It’s taken a long time for the world to act but finally we’re&nbsp;coming together to resist this uniquely 21st century evil.</p><p>At the heart of the resistance are developers. Whatever role you have, whatever programming language or software&nbsp;you use - the battle is at your door.</p><p>In this session we’ll brief you on the state of the situation and what you can do to be more prepared:&nbsp;we’ll look at the&nbsp;bad guys and how they operate, we’ll examine recent legal and government responses and, most importantly, how the&nbsp;software industry is working together to create the tools, frameworks and education needed to help us all become the&nbsp;developers we need to be.</p>",
