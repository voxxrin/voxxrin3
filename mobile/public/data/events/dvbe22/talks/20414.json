  "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 43, 77);\">React 18 just launched earlier this year, with a feature React developers have been looking forward to for a long time: Server Components. In this workshop, youâ€™ll learn the basics of what React Server Components are, how to effectively build and use them, while focusing on one of the major advantages of React: Reusability through components. Join Addison and Will from Miro to see how you can get ahead of the curve and start building reusable server components for your next project.</span></p>",
