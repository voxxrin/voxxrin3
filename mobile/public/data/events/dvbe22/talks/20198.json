  "description": "<p>Ever wanted to experiment with electronic components combined with software? With Java, a Raspberry Pi, and Pi4J you can!</p><p>In this short session, we will go from zero to hero and control a LED with a single class to interact with a LED (and more?) that is connected to one of the magic pins of a Raspberry Pi.</p><p>By using JBang we don't even need to install Java, Maven, or any other tool. JBang and a text editor are all we need to create an application that can interact with the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins of the Raspberry Pi to control components, read states, handle events, etc.</p>",
