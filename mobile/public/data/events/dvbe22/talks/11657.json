  "description": "<p>LITTIL started as an initiative of Devoxx4Kids Netherlands during the covid period. How can we teach children programming while we are all limited by the covid regulations.</p><p>In this talk we show how we started with LITTIL as a greenfield open source project to bring our IT volunteers in contact with primary schools. Why? We support small Devoxx4Kids days in the classroom.</p><p>Let me show you what we build and how we love to let people all over the world use this platform for free. After this talk I hope not only the Netherlands will bring these great Devoxx4Kids days to their schools, but also other countries.</p>",
