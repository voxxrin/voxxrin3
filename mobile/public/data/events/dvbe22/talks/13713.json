  "description": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Beer brewing can be fun, but combining brewing with IoT device hacking is even more fun. Using open source technologies, it is possible to connect and collect data about almost anything, including the fermentation process inside a closed fermenter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In this three-part presentation, you will learn how to use JavaScript to program microcontrollers and IoT devices. You will then learn the basics of beer brewing. Finally, you will see how you can use serverless technologies and a document database to process, manage, and analyze data produced by those IoT devices.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">And if you’re new to beer brewing, don’t worry; you will also learn a thing or two about that as well!</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
