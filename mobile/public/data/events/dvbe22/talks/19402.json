  "description": "<p>Women are underrepresented in the digital realm. Today, they represent only 28 to 30% of employees, all professions combined.</p><p>What happened in this professional sector, however dominated by women during its genesis? Would women no longer feel in their place or not?</p><p>Some disturbing findings:</p><ul><li>higher education leading to digital technology is invested in by men;</li><li>recruitment advertisements are not, as a rule, thought and written for women;</li><li>tech teams don't think about the deep needs of women or diversity;</li><li>women do not feel heard.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Even if women communicate, it seems that we do not listen to them.</p><p>And what are the results? Migration to corollary professions, brown-out, disembodiment in the team, resignations, creation of FemTech.</p><p>On a diverse spectrum, they lead the creation of safe places as a room of community expression.</p><p>So, if you want to promote diversity beyond the trend, and you have understood that the helping women in tech is a breach in solving the issue of diversity and inclusion, take part in my talk!</p>",
