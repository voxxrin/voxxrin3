  "title": "Ultra-fast Java Microservices: overcome the pitfalls of data persistence",
  "description": "<p>The persistence mechanism is the heart of most applications and microservices, although architects often happen not to give as much attention to such components. A wrong choice and design, will impact the whole system's functioning, no matter how much you scale up the service. Join this session and learn how to avoid this from happening.</p><p>In this guided lab, you'll learn tips and tricks on creating a healthier app with an increased performance by improving its relation with database persistence.&nbsp;</p><p>From a Java perspective, you'll try not only more conventional options like SQL and NoSQL but also some trendy new solutions in the market like MicroStream. You'll also have hands-on experience with this open-source ultrafast in-memory data persistence storage allows queries to be up to 1000x times faster than traditional relational databases.</p>",
