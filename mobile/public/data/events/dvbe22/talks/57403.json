  "description": "<p>Java&nbsp;is an established language, with advanced VMs, robust package libraries, mature frameworks, dynamic&nbsp;and&nbsp;reflective capabilities, a large tooling selection,&nbsp;and&nbsp;a sizeable developer ecosystem.&nbsp;Rust&nbsp;is a younger systems programming language that can have small memory footprint, low CPU utilization, offer low latencies&nbsp;and&nbsp;have small application sizes.</p><ul><li>But how do these characteristics pan out in the real world?</li><li>How easy is it to take advantage of them?</li><li>Is one language “better” than the other?</li><li>Are they really so different?</li></ul><p>In this talk we will take a journey with the two languages&nbsp;and&nbsp;we will review our experience in designing&nbsp;and&nbsp;building a sample application with the same requirements in both&nbsp;Rust&nbsp;and&nbsp;Java. We will compare the development experiences&nbsp;and&nbsp;how they each perform. We’ll share our thoughts&nbsp;and&nbsp;conclusions on where&nbsp;Rust&nbsp;and&nbsp;Java&nbsp;could be improved.&nbsp;And&nbsp;we’ll talk about how we see each being used in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
