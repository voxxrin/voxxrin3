  "description": "<p>Using ‘real’ data may be tempting, yet under the GDPR it’s not a good idea when dealing with personal information. Unfortunately, testing or debugging software may be harder without having full access to all underlying data. A synthetic dataset can be a good solution: generating fictitious replacement data, that mimics the structure and distribution of the original data.</p><p>Joachim Ganseman from Smals Research talks about how synthetic data can be generated, and especially about the practical concerns and limitations.</p><ul><li>How do we deal with rarely occurring values, correlations or dependencies?</li><li>What about the balance between maximum privacy protection vs. retaining enough functional usability?</li><li>Can we do reliable analytics on a synthetic dataset?</li></ul><p>He will share some practical examples using open source software in Python.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
