# Voxxr.in

Voxxrin is your mobile conference companion.

## Project structure

Voxxrin is a mobile app developed using ionic / capacitor + vue, wth a serverless backend relying on several Firebase services (auth, firestore, cloud functions).

The mobile app is located in the `mobile` directory, and serverless firebase code is located in the `cloud` directory.

Each of these directories have their own `README.md` describing how to set them up.

## How to add your own conference to the list ?

Voxxrin is currently in a closed beta mode.

However, if you are interested into adding your conference to the list, drop us an email at `contact` at `voxxr.in`, describing where we can retrieve your schedule (API ? Website ?).

We will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
