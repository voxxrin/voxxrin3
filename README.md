# Voxxr.in

Voxxrin is your mobile conference companion.

## Project structure

Voxxrin is a mobile app developed using ionic / capacitor + vue, wth a serverless backend relying on several Firebase services (auth, firestore, cloud functions).

The mobile app is located in the `mobile` directory, and serverless firebase code is located in the `cloud` directory.

Each of these directories have their own `README.md` describing how to set them up.
